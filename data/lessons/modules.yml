- title: "Housing Burden: Essentials"
  description: |
    We look at the amount people of Chicago need to invest in housing. There is an interesting dataset from the city of Chicago.

    We first create a basic Choropleth map to visualize the housing burden per neighborhood. The info window will include a bubble map as well with additional data.

    We then move forward and create a dashboard with interactivity, tables, and small multiples.

      <description>Comparison of Mapbox GL JS vs D3.js    Mapbox map   D3 map   When you want to create an online-map from your data you have a ton of options available.
When I teach d3 or talk to people what tools they&amp;rsquo;re using the questions that comes up a lot is: &amp;ldquo;How do d3 and mapboxGL compare?&amp;rdquo;.
That is the question that I want to answer on this site.</description>

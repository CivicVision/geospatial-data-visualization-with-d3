      <description>d attribute in path The infamous d attribute in a path element for SVG is a handful. Or at least at first. Especially for mapping.
Let‘s look at a d attribute for a geojson feature:
const feature = { &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Feature&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;geometry&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Polygon&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;coordinates&amp;#34;: [ [ [ 13.31, 52.79 ], [ 13.35, 52.79 ], [ 13.35, 52.80 ], [ 13.31, 52.80 ], [ 13.31, 52.79 ]]] } };  M2.</description>

      <description>Updating your chart Updating your d3 chart used to be a bit confusing for most people.
The data pattern takes some time to understand properly and when I teach d3 courses people always got trip up on it.
But d3 version 5 just made it a whole lot easier to use and understand.
There is a new method: join And with it we don&amp;rsquo;t need to use enter and exit directly anymore.</description>

      <description>Projections Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about projections!
We need projections to create an actual map.
Geospatial data is usally in the form of latitude and longitude but in the browser we don&amp;rsquo;t have these concepts.
We only have x and y coordinates.
 Goal: Our goal is to transform geo-coordinates to screen-coordinates.
 Projections are just math. And what they do is transform latitude and longitude coordinates to x and y coordinates on a flat surface (e.</description>

      <description>How to create a simple tooltip in d3   A common question I see on stackoverflow a lot is around Tooltips.
There are a bunch of examples out there but people sometimes confuse their intention.
So I thought I create a short post about Tooltips for d3.
Goal of a tooltip The goal of the tooltip is to show information on things when you hover over them.
And in our specific case we want the tooltip to follow the mouse.</description>

      <description>Comparison of Mapbox GL JS vs D3.js    Mapbox map   D3 map   When you want to create an online-map from your data you have a ton of options available.
When I teach d3 or talk to people what tools they&amp;rsquo;re using the questions that comes up a lot is: &amp;ldquo;How do d3 and mapboxGL compare?&amp;rdquo;.
That is the question that I want to answer on this site.</description>

      <description>SVG Basics for d3 When you start learning or using d3 you will come across SVGs. That‘s what most people use when they create a visualization with d3. And it‘s the easier choice and the more documented one. So you need to understand a few basic concepts of SVG to make better use of d3 and learn faster.
In this short post I will show you three elements of SVG that are worth knowing.</description>

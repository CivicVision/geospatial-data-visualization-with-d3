  Most people learn d3 by looking at examples and changing parts of it to fit their needs. You iterate on these examples, look at the documentation, maybe consult a book or look at videos on YouTube.
  <br />
  But people get frustrated using this method. Here are people sharing their struggles on twitter, Slack, forums and stackoverflow:

    After looking at a few d3.js demos, I had thought that the above task would be trivially easy with d3.js, but in fact I have found it to be insanely difficult.

    Most of the resources I’ve found are either old (v3, I know I can still follow them, but I’d rather follow a v4 tutorial) or very convoluted. It seems like I spend half my time trying to figure out why the graph won’t compile.

    I want to just jump in, yet it seems like I need to know a bunch of the api to get even a simple graph up.

    Inspired by the amazing @milafrerichs #D3 workshop at #foss4gna, I was able to create an interactive globe map of my twitter friends.

{{< text "Let your data shine.">}}
Are you tired of maps which distract your audience from reading the map because of the basemap being too distracting, too shiny and too overrepresented?

{{< text "Online video course">}}
In this online video course I will show you how to create distraction-free (interactive) maps with d3.

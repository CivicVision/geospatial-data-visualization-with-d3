  Most people learn d3 by looking at examples and changing parts of it to fit their needs.

  You iterate on these examples, look at the documentation, maybe consult a book or look at videos on YouTube.

  Here are people sharing their struggles on twitter, Slack, forums and stackoverflow:

  {{< quote >}}
    "After looking at a few d3.js demos, I had thought that the above task would be trivially easy with d3.js, but in fact I have found it to be insanely difficult."
  {{</ quote >}}
  {{< quote >}}
    "Most of the resources I’ve found are either old (v3, I know I can still follow them, but I’d rather follow a v4 tutorial) or very convoluted. It seems like I spend half my time trying to figure out why the graph won’t compile."

    "I want to just jump in, yet it seems like I need to know a bunch of the api to get even a simple graph up."

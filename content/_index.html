  Learning d3 can be hard
  {{</ headline >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  You not only need to learn d3 but a lot of other concepts before that.  

  - SVG/Canvas
  - HTML
  - Javascript

  There are a lot of ways of doing things in d3. There is no one approach.  
  If you search on social networks and google, there are a ton of tweets and blog posts about why d3 is hard for them.  
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
    "I want to just jump in, yet it seems like I need to know a bunch of the api to get even a simple graph up."
  {{</ quote >}}
  {{< headline >}}
  Learning with examples is frustrating
  {{</ headline >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Most people learn d3 by looking at examples and changing parts of it to fit their needs. 
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  You iterate on these examples, look at the documentation, maybe consult a book or look at videos on YouTube.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  But people get __frustrated__ using this method. 
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
    "After looking at a few d3.js demos, I had thought that the above task would be trivially easy with d3.js, but in fact I have found it to be insanely difficult."
  {{</ quote >}}
  <h3>Undocumented example code makes it harder to learn</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  A lot of examples don't have of comments or explanations. Which makes it hard to understand what is being done.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
  "Without comments and explanations of what is happening along the way, it’s very hard for someone starting out to figure out what’s going on."
  {{</ quote >}}
  <h3>Potentially bad code is hard to fix</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Everyone can create examples with d3, and it's hard to know the experience level of the creator.  
  Examples may have bad or repetitive code. 
  If you learn with these possibly bad examples, you could learn the wrong things.  
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
  "There’s the problem of blocks that are written with bad code, or don’t include the necessary data files or libraries."
  {{</ quote >}}
  <h3>Old examples lead to more frustration</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Thanks to the introduction of [observable](https://observable.org) more examples are created with the current version of d3. But on [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org) a majority of examples are still created with v3 which was replaced in 2016 with v4.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
    "Most of the resources I’ve found are either old (v3, I know I can still follow them, but I’d rather follow a v4 tutorial) or very convoluted. It seems like I spend half my time trying to figure out why the graph won’t compile."
  {{</ quote >}}
  {{< headline >}}
  Most d3.js tutorials only scratch the surface
  {{</ headline >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
  "I’ve gone through some tutorials but I find that they only scratch the surface and are often fragmented — learning the code for building a scale doesn’t mean anything to me without the accompanying chart."

    Inspired by the amazing @milafrerichs #D3 workshop at #foss4gna, I was able to create an interactive globe map of my twitter friends.

{{< text "How this course is different" >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  __Geospatial Data Visualization with d3__ will help you take a more focussed approach for learning d3. 
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  <h3>Retain more by learning with projects</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Project-based learning is believed to result in more in-depth knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< quote >}}
  "[Project-based learning] encourages higher order critical thinking and de-emphasizes memorization. Increases motivation to learn in order to arrive at a solution. "
  {{</ quote >}}
  <h3>Self-check your learning</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Check what you learn after each section with exercises.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  <h3>Stay on top of your learning path</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Weekly accountability emails will help you stay on top of your learning experience and keep you motivated.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  <h3>Modeled from successful hands-on workshops</h3>
  {{< paragraph >}}
  This course is modeled from hands-on workshops at geospatial conferences I gave over the last three years. 
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  I iterated on the format, the course content, and examples over the years to land on this course format and content.
  {{</ paragraph >}}
  {{< paragraph >}}
  Conferences I gave this workshop at:

  - FOSS4G UK 2019
  - FOSS4G Noth America 2019
  - FOSS4G Oceania 2018
  - FOSS4G 2017

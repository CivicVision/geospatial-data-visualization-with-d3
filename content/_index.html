      <p class="mt-6">
        Most developers assume <a href="https://d3js.org">d3.js</a> is just good for charts but d3.js is actually great for maps as well.<br/>
        And it's not that complicated to create your first map with d3.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">D3.js maps are different.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">You provide the data that is displayed and if you want to include a basemap you can, but most often you won't need to. D3.js maps are very clutter-free by default. <br/>You provide all the details you want.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-light">With great power comes great responsibility</h2>
      <p class="mt-6">Since you have all the power to create a map to your liking you are responsible for most of the things. <br/>There are a lot of helpers inside the library that will make things easier but you're still responsible of addin them.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        On this page I want to give you an overview how you can create maps with d3. <br/>
